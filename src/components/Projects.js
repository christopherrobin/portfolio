Minor league hockey can sometimes be hard to keep up with due to the smaller fan base and frequency of player trades. Information travels slow and isnâ€™t always readily available. This app fixes that by aggregating data from 3 different sources and presenting them in an organized and focused manner for users that want to follow their favorite ECHL hockey team. Current features are spoiler free game results, upcoming schedule information with ticket sales links, and all incoming/outgoing Indy Fuel roster moves."
